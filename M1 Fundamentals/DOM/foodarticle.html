    <p>Food is one of the basic necessities of life. Food contains <span class="keyword" >nutrientsâ€”substances</span> essential for the growth, repair, and maintenance of body tissues and for the regulation of <span class="keyword"> vital processes</span>. Nutrients provide the <span class="keyword"> energy</span> our bodies need to function.</p>
    <p> The energy in food is measured in units called <span class="keyword">calories</span>. Age, sex, weight, height, and level of activity determine the number of calories a person needs each day. Depending on age, sex, and activity level, the recommended <span class="keyword"> daily caloric intake></span> for a child aged 11 to 14 can range anywhere from <span class="keyword"> 1,600 to 2,600 calories per day></span>, with sedentary girls needing the fewest calories and active boys needing the most. For adults, this can range from 1,800 to about 3,000.</p>
